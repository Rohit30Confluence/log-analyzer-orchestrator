# Log Analyzer Orchestrator

> Deployment, monitoring, and DNS automation layer for the Log Analyzer Attack Detection platform ‚Äî enabling streamlined CI/CD, environment sync, and production stability.

## üß† Overview
The **Log Analyzer Orchestrator** automates infrastructure operations, manages service reliability, and monitors runtime stability for the main [Log Analyzer Attack Detection](https://github.com/Rohit30Confluence/log-analyzer-attack-detection) repository.

This system ensures:
- Automated CI/CD deploys across environments  
- Smart DNS mapping for service continuity  
- Continuous health checks and uptime logging  
- Deployment issue resolution and rollback triggers  

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **FastAPI-based microservice**
- **Render-compatible CI/CD YAML**
- **Redis-backed event store (optional)**
- **DNS resolver abstraction** for multiple providers
- **Automated health monitoring** integrated with status API

## üöÄ Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt
python orchestrator/main.py

## üß© CI/CD Pipeline

.github/workflows/ci.yml ‚Üí runs linting, tests, and validation

.github/workflows/deploy.yml ‚Üí deploys to Render / Railway

.github/workflows/issue-auto-label.yml ‚Üí auto-tags deployment or DNS issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If deployment fails or DNS resolves incorrectly, open an issue using the provided templates under:

.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

## ü§ù Contributions

This repository acts as a pillar to the main Log Analyzer project.
Contributions to improve orchestration, fault tolerance, or deployment automation are welcome.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Roadmap

 Setup orchestration repo

 Automate Render + DNS sync

 Integrate Redis for state caching

 Build API dashboard for runtime status

 Implement predictive deployment analysis
